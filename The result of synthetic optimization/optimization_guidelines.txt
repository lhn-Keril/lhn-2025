# Carbon Dot Synthesis Optimization Guidelines (Based on XGBoost Model)

## Best FL Prediction Model: XGBoost
- Test Set R²: 0.9032
- Top 5 Influential Features:
  1. Temp_sq
  2. urea_sq
  3. Time(h)
  4. Temp(℃)
  5. Urea(g)

## Synthesis Recommendations:
1. Urea amount: 0.8–1.2 g yields higher FL (both lower and higher reduce FL)
2. Reaction temperature: 150–170 °C optimal (excessive temp causes over-carbonization)
3. GSH/Urea ratio ≈ 0.2:1 performs best
4. Reaction time: 6–9 hours ideal; longer duration may cause fluorescence quenching
5. FA volume: 10–15 mL preferred for better dispersion and FL

## Approximate Prediction Behavior:
FL ≈ f(GSH, Urea, FA, Temperature, Time, GSH/Urea, Temp×Time, ...)
